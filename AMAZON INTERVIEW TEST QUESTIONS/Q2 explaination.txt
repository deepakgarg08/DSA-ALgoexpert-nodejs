divide the string length by total number of rows ,it will give you 2d array column length
loop for column = to column n-1
start with the first character
The next character of string would be IndexOfPreviousChar +ColumnLength + 1
if step 4 returns length value out of bound then use the next char from the first row of 2darray
once all these steps are over replace all "_" with space and then trim the string.
